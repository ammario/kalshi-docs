# Making Your First Request

> Start trading with Kalshi API in under 5 minutes

To make your request we recommend testing a public endpoint like [GetMarkets](https://docs.kalshi.com/api-reference/market/get-markets). As you explore our other endpoints, you'll notice some endpoints return an authentication\_error. If you want to experiment with these endpoints, you will need to get [API Keys](https://docs.kalshi.com/getting_started/api_keys). You may also want to sign up for a demo account to test without real funds.

The following resources might help you on your journey to exploring Kalshi's markets:

* [**Python starter code**](https://github.com/Kalshi/kalshi-starter-code-python/tree/main) bare-bones API interactions with authentication examples (also see [API Keys](https://docs.kalshi.com/getting_started/api_keys))
* [**Python starter code 2**](https://kalshi-public-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/KalshiAPIStarterCodeWithApiKey.zip) this Python client is not maintained, but you may still find it useful as a reference for how to call certain endpoints
* [**Discord**](https://discord.gg/kalshi) and check out #dev and #support
